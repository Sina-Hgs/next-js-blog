# Next JS Blog 

This is a blog made with **Next JS**, **Typescript**, & **Tailwind**.

The project featuers many of the Next JS cutting edge abilities. The blog posts are markdown files made into html syntax with packages like *grey-matter*, *remark*, & *rehype*. 

Each blog post has a page of it own with _**dynamic routing**_ and metadata specific to its own (as seen in the screenshot below).
The posts get rendered using ***SSG*** method while other components of the webpage are ***CSR*** or ***SSR***.

The app also features a tailored *not found* page for routes that aren't available. This project uses the *app folder routing* method which was introduced in Next Js 13. The styling was done with **_TailwindCSS_** and is fully responsive with both dark mode and light mode.

To see the app for yourself download the project and run one of the command lines from below:
