# Next JS Blog 

This is a blog made with **Next JS**, **Typescript**, & **Tailwind**.

The project featuers many of the Next JS cutting edge abilities. The blog posts are markdown files made into html syntax with packages like *grey-matter* and *remark*. 

Each blog post has a page of it own with dynamic routing and metadata specific to its own.

The posts get rendered using *SSG* method while other components of the webpage are *CSR* or *SSR*. 

The app also features a tailored *not found* page for routes that aren't available. This project uses the *app folder routing* method which was introduced in Next Js 13.

*The app is currently under development and is not the final version but it's still completely functional.*
